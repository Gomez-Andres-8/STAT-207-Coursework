    "Starting last year, STAT 107 and STAT 207 (along with other courses) count as requirements towards a new suite of majors called \"X+Data Science\" majors.  We are interested in learning more about students who enroll in STAT 107.  From Fall 2019 to Fall 2023, approximately 2300 students enrolled in STAT 107.  Rather than track down and ask each of these 2300 students questions, we will use the students in <i>this lab section</i> (who have presumably taken STAT 107) in an attempt to learn more about the larger population of **all students who have taken STAT 107 in the last nine semesters**.

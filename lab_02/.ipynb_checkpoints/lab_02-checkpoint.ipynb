    "    - if the row corresponds to a 'play' activity, this number represents the number of hours the user has played the game\n",
    "    - if the row corresponds to a 'purchase' activity, this number is always a 1 (and means nothing... it's a placeholder).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for each user-game combo, there will either be one row (if the game has only been purchased but not played) or two rows (if the game has been both purchased and played).  For example, if I bought Portal, a row would be added to the data representing the purchase of that game by me.  When I open the game and start playing it, a second row would be added to the data representing that I have played the game along with recording my play time for that specific game.\n",

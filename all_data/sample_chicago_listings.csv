It has become a magnet for sports fans and young professionals alike, and particularly singles who hop from bar to bar along Clark, Addison and Sheffield Avenues. Rather tame by day, the neighborhood's souvenir shops and casual eateries are open but quiet. For late night entertainment, a boisterous after-hours crowd heads to Wrigleyville for everything from live music to sketch comedy. But if there's a day game or a night game letting out at ""The Friendly Confines"" then look out: the streets swell with the masses of fans looking to celebrate a Cubs win. <br /><br />SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS: <br />LAKEVIEW Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east and dotted with train stops from two ‘L' lines, Lakeview is one of Chicago's liveliest and most accessible neigh",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/6de1624e-5ede-4003-84d2-85bf47631974.jpg,1597671,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1597671,Naomi And JJ,4084,"Chicago, IL","Hi, we're Naomi and JJ. We've been avid Airbnb users for several years and since we loved Airbnb so much we decided to start hosting Airbnb stays in 2016.  

Naomi is a native Chicagoan (aka loyal Chicago Cubs' fan) who works in the tourism industry. While JJ, originally from Chicago's western suburbs, has been living in Wrigleyville and Boystown for over the last 15 years and is a whiz with our home automation (keypad king).  We also co-host our spaces with our retired parents Piya and Richard (who used to own two Pan Asian restaurants).  We have a ton of local tips about Chicago that we would love to share with you. In particular, we live to eat so have some great local eats suggestions for you.

Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.
Pricing & calendar availability is accurate on FHS website only.

Born and raised Chicago, I have passion for the city and it's central neighborhoods.  My career has been a combination of visual design, architecture, residential real estate and event planning.  Most recently, I have started sharing my hosting expertise with others. 

On a personal note, I enjoy reading, art, food and fitness.  Annually, I participate in the AvonWalk for Breast Cancer raising money for research and treatment (I have funded over 100 mammograms)!  I also enjoy traveling with my two daughters- this year we hope to visit Mexico, South Africa and Barcelona!! 

As a host, I strive to achieve a hotel level of amenities and comfort.  I hope you agree!!

Life in this neighborhood was explored in Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle. The area was formerly part of the town of Lake until it was annexed by Chicago in 1889. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area was occupied largely by Eastern European immigrants and their descendants, who were predominantly ethnic Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak.[2]<br /><br />In the 1930s the activist Saul Alinsky did community organizing in this area, as its people suffered during the Great Depression. This work led to his founding the Industrial Areas Foundation in 1940, which trained community organizers.[3]<br /><br />Jane Jacobs in her 1961 book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, cites the Back of the Yards as an area able to ""unslum"" in the 1960s, due to a beneficial set of circum",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-38454628/original/d8b5a016-3636-4df8-8d18-fea9f4e20ee9.jpeg,226582852,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/226582852,Jane And Kris,1581,"Chicago, IL",I love to meet new people and share my home with them :),within a few hours,100.0,83.0,False,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0b54f1f8-376c-440e-96ff-be5e68b06460.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0b54f1f8-376c-440e-96ff-be5e68b06460.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Back of the Yards,17,29,"['email', 'phone']",True,True,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",New City,,41.80515,-87.64621,Private room in rental unit,Private room,1,,1 shared bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Oven"", ""First aid kit"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Essentials"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free street parking"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Paid washer \u2013 In unit"", ""Paid dryer \u2013 In building"", ""Iron"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Stove"", ""Backyard"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Toaster"", ""Heating"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Wifi"", ""Bathtub"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Microwave"", ""Cooking basics""]",37.0,28,365,28,28,365,365,28.0,365.0,,True,30,60,90,270,2023-03-19,1,1,0,144.0,144.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,R19000039905,False,17,2,15,0,0.21,61,New City,51721,44377,43628,13813,3.136176066,38971.68675,2807.53012,9136.686747,8504.481928,8346.626506,5388.783133,3018.337349,1504.963855,264.2771084,33.10160771,4815.819277,24095.39759,9006.86747,725.6024096,328.0,38617.90275,29311.92108,18485.20848,15374.91048,3110.297998,10826.7126,14919.45112,833.4381625,14086.01296,7447.228504,2496.014134,3199.37338,720.9976443,222.3992933,509705.2415,3745.222076,5559.339685,2934.049934,1030.782523,24212.51807,7419.951807,9475.156627,3790.554217,1300.096386,1567.289157,659.4698795,4988.283298,3713.300211,1853.987315,1262.930233,842.9302326,603.0761099,35396.3424,18005.11013,13264.5074,4512.11985,8754.71161,2510.731501,15777.66292,3962.089888,210.5917603,6003.775281,3651.179775,1051.026217,59.0,407.0,433.0,5.414453311,1028.479401,2076.614232,4242.543071,8430.026217,1936.790077,1048.808989,6786.333333,5736.337079,1520.719101,685.4644195,2151.198732,1882.877378,365.0274841,106.0,154987.8477,8444.403805,991.6701903,5329.754757,1857.978858,265.0,0.0,798.0487731,10788.94292,2113.983087,2475.564482,10587.94292,10004.94292,2676.564482,12486,Health Care,Accommodation and Food Service,Administration,Manufacturing,Retail Trade,1572,1460,1364,1348,1296,10963,Manufacturing,Wholesale Trade,Retail Trade,Transportation,Other Service,3961,1762,1082,766,763,Outside of Chicago,The Loop,Near North Side,Near West Side,New City,4819,1722,762,725,571,Outside of Chicago,New City,Brighton Park,Gage Park,Chicago Lawn,4998,571,370,291,284,,,,11108.90407,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.016404769,0.076177653,0.907417578,1.708881576,3090.839377,244.9375784,0.079246298,328.0891063,0.10614887,30.8701408,0.009987624,155.0514493,0.050164836,94.56597553,0.030595564,722.2718265,0.23368145,1143.480819,0.369958021,0.0,0.0,83.76399579,0.027100728,287.8084858,0.09311661,4214.803383,2840.852008,2145.564482,4063.287526,8285.704017,2345.917548,4978.803383,3161.519711,149.0,133.0,2879.519711,4828.714849,691.2444152,1455.587385,2681.883049,1853.20565,944.4743758,592.2095926,316.521682,2709.890276,2152.978318,439.4868594,117.4250986,28372.73263,10599.06949,36167.94935,20619.91402,10147.54888,15548.03534,19748.9788,216.7997644,479.155477,6.0,0.0,0.0,116.0,52.0,0.979976443,6789,25948,18252,146,586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.999017682,0.555383955,0.145995287,0.77199033,0.0,0.0,0.172919445,1.0,1.0,0.485930968

Our apartments are in the south and west loop of downtown Chicago. The museums, stadiums (United Center, Soldier Field, etc.), and McCormick Place, Thalia hall, China town, University of Illinois, University of Chicago,  Rush university, Medical district are all close and easily accessible. The magnificent mile is: 9 minutes by bus and 5 minutes by taxi or Uber. 

Some of the apartments are 420 friendly; ask about it if you are interested! 
 
We are friendly people who enjoy meeting new friends and traveling. We have lived in the Caribbean, London, and New York before moving to Chicago. Came to Chicago primarily for school but then we loved it and decided to stay. Yes, we love Chicago, and even the winter is GREAT! Good food options are unbelievably amazing in Chicago.

I have multiple apartments on this website. Some of the apartments are  3 bedrooms, bathroom, living room, dining room, and kitchen. Some are two bedrooms, bathroom, living, and kitchen and the others are 1 bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. We provide additional airbeds if needed. The airbeds are extremely comfortable and are queen size and 18 inches high. 

All the apartments have free WiFi, guestbooks, and basic amenities such as TV, iron, iron board, refrigerator, hair dryer, with water, pop, and juice, microwave, coffee maker, cups, plates, pots, pans, bathroom towels, shower items, etc.

Airbnb is extremely fun for us since we are also international.  We have traveled to most of the states in the US, London, Milan,  Italy, Turkey. I have also attended Universities on both sides of the Atlantic (London and Chicago). 

Favorite music are Reggae, R&B, hip hop, Latin music, country music. I love to eat and my favorite food are fish, fruits, and vegetables. My favorite sports are rock climbing, archery, diving, soccer, and basketball. 

These days if I am not out with friends, I am with family, or spending time on the computer.

Free wifi, and a rare find in Chicago - free street parking!(when available, which is usually often.)<br /><br />More about the space and the area:<br />A converted storefront, Blush Lounge is located in the west loop area, in one of the most entertaining neighborhoods in Chicago, close to all the sights, where there is always something to do.<br />This private bedroom has a big, comfy full size bed and a 32"" LCD monitor and a DVD player, sorry no cable.

Tracy and Josue here. :) We've been living in Chicago for quite some time now. Beautiful city to travel to! A little bit about us. I (Tracy) used to be a photographer but decided to change careers and become a Mortician.  Josue is a Socialite, Traveller, Humanitarian, Activist, Producer and Investor. We love everything we do and hosting for Airbnb is definitely one of them.  When our guests are happy we are happy. We will do everything we can to make your stay as comfortable and amazing as possible. Josue is great with directions, places to check out, things to do, events and nightlife. He knows how to make an awesome drink as well! I love to cook and try new recipes. We both like to go out and experience nightlife, love being foodies and trying out new restaurants when the time permits. Love to travel as well, but Chicago is our Home for now! We are happy to share the experience!

Further south is Midway Airport -- 11 miles from our house, as is O'Hare Airport 11 miles north.

Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability.

I am Giovannie (but you can call me Gio).  I have lived in Chicago for most of my life and spent a few years adulting out in our nations capital Washington, DC.  I absolutely love to travel and trying out new restaurants.  I am not ashamed to say that I have taken trips that soley revolved around trying out the local cuisine(shoutout Guy Fieri).  

One of my passions is real estate management/investing.  As a guest, I understand that the home has a host who is affected by my stay.  As a host, I understand that it is important for the guest to feel at home and comfortable.  My goal is to contribute to a positive experience as both a guest and a host.

The space features wonderful large windows in both rooms and has all of the quirky charm that vintage buildings offer up. The location literally can't be beat, with the apartment a four-minute walk from Wrigley Field, the bustling Southport shopping corridor, and both the red line and brown line subway stations.  It's also a walk to all of the 'Boystown' nightlife.  There is no parking available with the apartment.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />This apartment was originally a shoe repair store!  The neighborhood used to be full of tiny shops at ground level. I've used my years of experience as a superhost and designer to set up this unique flat so that it includes all the comforts of home while embracing the quirky charm that only a vintage building can offer. <br /><br />Please keep in mind that because my flat is located in a 100+ year-old urban building on the ground floor, you may occasionally find an errant cobweb or two, in spi",,https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-49290332/original/1f740d5f-a418-47eb-87c7-1ee868aed933.jpeg,3230291,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3230291,David,3872,"Chicago, IL","Born in a small town in Indiana, I have spent the majority of my life living in Chicago.  I own a small interior design firm and have spent the last 20 years trying to make things nice for myself and others. 

I was an early adopter of airbnb, joining the platform when I was renting a two bedroom flat and had a housemate move out unexpectedly.  I’ve spent my time as a host trying to figure out what an ideal airbnb experience is like…and I quickly realized how much pleasure it gives me to create an amazing place to share with travelers.  

Even though I am not hosting folks in my own home (I have a geriatric cat who no longer likes strangers) I want my guests to really experience an authentic slice of Chicago.

Lang House Chicago is a professionally managed vacation rental in the Rogers Park neighborhood.  Chicago is all about neighborhoods, architecture and history.  Lang House Chicago has it all; located right on Sheridan Road just 1 block from Lake Michigan, Lang House is a Four Square Prairie Style home designed by Edgar Newman and built in 1919.  The home is beautifully preserved and elegantly appointed.  

My team includes professional property managers and hospitality staff.  We  work for a company that restores and manages historically significant homes.  Lang House Chicago is a home that reflects the pride and love of many of us on the management team.  We are happy to be your hosts! 

My name is Carmen and I have lived in Chicago for 11 years, having moved around the country throughout my life, and settling here with my family.  It had always been my dream to live in Chicago due to the rich architecture,  which is unlike that of any other city in the world.  I have grown to love the lake and the history of this city.      

Please send a message if you have any questions about the home or the neighborhood.  I can also help you with recommendations for local restaurants and must-see attractions in Chicago.

Our immediate neighborhood was developed on land originally owned by Graceland Cemetery, which is our neighbor to the East. It is a worthwhile walking trip and contains the graves of many of Chicago's founding fathers and commercial elite. Immediately South of us is Southport Avenue which contains a diverse group of restaurants, bars, shops, the Mercury live theater and The Music Box cinema theater. It is a pleasant walk on your way to or from our other historic landmark - Wrigley Field - home of the Chicago Cubs baseball club. We are also walking distance to the Black Ensemble Theater to our North which produces live musical shows centered on diverse musicians. We are a longer walk to Lincoln Avenue and the historic Old Town School of Folk Music with its regular classes and concert venues.

My name is Carmen and I have lived in Chicago for 11 years, having moved around the country throughout my life, and settling here with my family.  It had always been my dream to live in Chicago due to the rich architecture,  which is unlike that of any other city in the world.  I have grown to love the lake and the history of this city.      

Please send a message if you have any questions about the home or the neighborhood.  I can also help you with recommendations for local restaurants and must-see attractions in Chicago.

There are also pack n play, diaper gene, high chair and baby tub. The wall plugs are covered to keep away curious fingers.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />The house is a 2 flat and you have access to 2 floors, garage and laundry.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />Also, there is a smart TV in the living room and 2 rooms have Roku TVs.  They are all connected to the apartment's powerfu","Although the house is on a quiet, tree-lined street, the neighborhood is vibrant. <br /><br />The 'El' is just a couple blocks away. It's a Blue Line stop that goes out to O'Hare airport or heads directly downtown where there are transfers available to the other trains that can take you all over the city. <br /><br />It's difficult to list all of the interesting proprietors within just a half mile of the house. There are many restaurants (including Japanese, Mexican, Cuban, Italian, breakfast diners, fast food, etc), many bars (including breweries, taprooms, dives, even an arcade bar), groceries, bowling, gym and coffee houses. Also, just around the corner is a stand-up comedy joint and a live music venue.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-720807369103157062/original/93e04900-593e-49d1-ae9e-3b7b2313fc88.jpeg,64566942,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/64566942,Fabiolla,2549,"Chicago, IL",,within a few hours,88.0,83.0,False,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a1aebb3a-acee-4fb5-8d6c-92d232ce4c4a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a1aebb3a-acee-4fb5-8d6c-92d232ce4c4a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Logan Square,2,3,"['email', 'phone']",True,False,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",Logan Square,,41.919933662265535,-87.69009917724608,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,10,,2 baths,5.0,5.0,"[""Self check-in"", ""Oven"", ""Portable heater"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Blender"", ""First aid kit"", ""Clothing storage: closet, dresser, and walk-in closet"", ""Bed linens"", ""Outlet covers"", ""Dining table"", ""Board games"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib"", ""Conditioner"", ""Body soap"", ""Microwave"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free street parking"", ""Iron"", ""Children\u2019s dinnerware"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Coffee maker: pour-over coffee"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Dryer"", ""Stove"", ""Shower gel"", ""Freezer"", ""Coffee"", ""Keypad"", ""Washer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""High chair"", ""Baby bath"", ""Kitchen"", ""Toaster"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Portable fans"", ""Central heating"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Wifi"", ""Bathtub"", ""Refrigerator"", ""TV"", ""Cooking basics""]",150.0,32,365,32,32,365,365,32.0,365.0,,True,29,58,85,355,2023-03-19,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,True,2,2,0,0,,22,Logan Square,82715,72791,71665,32097,2.221827585,71374.0,4692.0,8430.0,28199.0,16793.0,8029.0,3108.0,1212.0,911.0,32.39190816,36851.0,25920.0,3233.0,3030.0,2340.0,70921.0,60446.21648,48688.25446,47035.18002,1648.07444,11757.96202,46019.01519,5565.052412,40453.96278,18142.8215,2461.94379,15642.10596,3408.710596,798.3809343,1354754.546,6820.133493,15604.39728,6509.64988,1783.597922,53559.0,4525.0,9039.0,5861.0,2459.0,19638.0,12037.0,4567.0,4322.0,4941.0,3996.0,5479.0,7441.0,84653.4034,52299.251,30746.0,11361.0,19385.0,2819.0,33565.0,4945.0,765.0,6745.0,8884.0,5323.0,1976.0,4798.0,129.0,5.370007987,4413.0,3684.0,3992.0,21476.0,1929.072686,8030.0,13381.0,8523.0,2678.0,953.0,422.0,1981.0,4352.0,4367.0,435179.1531,19017.0,1077.0,2976.0,6778.0,7087.0,1099.0,1394.638305,28112.0,1018.0,2634.0,27896.0,27082.0,2850.0,36513,Professional,Health Care,Accommodation and Food Service,Finance,Retail Trade,5215,3931,3539,3028,2929,16931,Retail Trade,Accommodation and Food Service,Health Care,Administration,Transportation,3081,2894,1744,1716,1650,Outside of Chicago,The Loop,Near North Side,Near West Side,Logan Square,10944,8121,4070,3183,1527,Outside of Chicago,Logan Square,West Town,Belmont Cragin,Lake View,6569,1527,683,545,531,,,,9716.676017,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.02739847,2297.005663,288.3799472,0.125546032,615.0997156,0.267783282,79.02986863,0.034405605,188.7370675,0.082166566,70.37522888,0.030637813,113.1787743,0.04927231,859.3098946,0.374100033,0.0,0.0,41.7395205,0.018171275,41.15564613,0.017917085,10378.0,11206.0,4773.0,4389.0,13637.0,1581.0,17109.0,3061.0,7.0,142.0,2912.0,5380.928058,208.3749001,980.0623501,4192.490807,4890.043965,867.3749001,2138.597922,1884.071143,16776.06555,10789.73781,4452.685851,1533.641886,60068.67186,11334.6373,66729.19445,22144.34789,9233.068363,44584.84656,18450.25636,1080.659324,297.164831,290.0,148.0,193.0,288.0,1309.676415,87.59096088,21742,53833,4290,1087,1763,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.637820196,0.893370098,0.0,0.0,0.056197382,1.0,1.0,0.588404872

I lived abroad, taught to thousands of international students, received grants and degrees by universities and foundations in United Kingdom and United States. While born and raised in Uruguay (as per the New York Times: the 'Switzerland' of Latin America for most of the country's history) we ran a small hotel in Punta del Este: a seaside city referred by Travel+Leisure and Newsweek as ""the St-Tropez of South America"", ""the Hamptons of Latin America"" or ""South America's Monaco"". My family was among the visionaries who settled in Punta del Este before it became internationally known as a jet set and tourist destination, built, and ran their hotel during sixty years. They originally emigrated to Uruguay from Italy, Turkey and Lithuania (escaped antisemitism, systemic racism, and poverty in Europe). As a teenager, I participated in my local 'Interact Club' or the youth division for Rotary International; fast forward twenty years as U.S. permanent resident, I now advocate for Airbnb Open Homes on humanitarian relief to refugees and Airbnb Project Lighthouse to fight social stigmata, and against discrimination.",within an hour,100.0,80.0,True,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ecaea114-5fec-4cde-a9ba-d4fe7b9a0209.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ecaea114-5fec-4cde-a9ba-d4fe7b9a0209.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,South Shore,7,10,"['email', 'phone']",True,True,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",South Shore,,41.76122,-87.58806,Entire guest suite,Entire home/apt,3,,1 bath,,2.0,"[""Free driveway parking on premises \u2013 1 space"", ""Self check-in"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Portable heater"", ""Blender"", ""First aid kit"", ""Clothing storage: closet"", ""Exercise equipment: yoga mat"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Bed linens"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Conditioner"", ""Body soap"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Shampoo"", ""Smart lock"", ""Free street parking"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Mini fridge"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Shower gel"", ""Shared backyard"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Mini-oven oven"", ""Coffee"", ""Vintage Sony sound system with aux"", ""Fast wifi \u2013 539 Mbps"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Toaster"", ""Central heating"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Portable fans"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""29\"" HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Roku, Netflix, HBO Max, Apple TV, Hulu"", ""Microwave"", ""BBQ grill""]",53.0,29,1125,11,29,1125,1125,11.7,1125.0,,True,0,23,53,328,2023-03-19,26,2,0,1323.0,263.0,4.77,4.77,4.69,4.85,4.96,4.38,4.81,R20000055861,False,6,3,2,1,0.59,43,South Shore,61556,52010,53971,25748,2.060043499,52740.0,3752.0,8928.0,11978.0,10218.0,10056.0,4861.0,1853.0,1094.0,37.28693561,1594.0,1371.0,48876.0,165.0,734.0,51611.0,41762.41435,27014.79896,22888.4138,4126.385161,14747.61538,22642.58947,1022.086197,21620.50327,10796.79433,1207.647845,8751.922531,546.754228,317.3843426,927478.5747,9913.145823,10755.31834,2840.874444,907.7839842,37010.0,3729.0,9051.0,11585.0,3223.0,5336.0,4086.0,9562.0,5481.0,4269.0,2155.0,1863.0,1154.0,35886.77751,27282.81953,24484.0,6075.0,18409.0,5813.0,30297.0,3650.0,826.0,2796.0,4539.0,8181.0,2037.0,8221.0,47.0,5.119072778,643.0,4152.0,11662.0,13840.0,1942.982676,11248.0,9801.0,6782.0,1721.0,745.0,2576.0,2412.0,635.0,443.0,165335.5705,18223.0,1764.0,9159.0,6052.0,1230.0,18.0,930.6204519,21280.0,4583.0,3204.0,20078.0,19370.0,4406.0,16930,Health Care,Administration,Accommodation and Food Service,Education,Retail Trade,3479,2062,1688,1559,1470,2911,Health Care,Retail Trade,Other Service,Construction,Administration,958,684,287,237,212,Outside of Chicago,The Loop,Near North Side,Near West Side,Hyde Park,5374,3595,1621,1125,478,Outside of Chicago,South Shore,Auburn Gresham,Chatham,Greater Grand Crossing,1083,323,95,91,86,,,,8713.419463,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.000263181,0.999736819,3.911524442,1877.323704,371.6346053,0.197959789,464.2687876,0.247303535,19.12894523,0.010189476,91.91254356,0.048959347,70.14477958,0.037364243,13.90031808,0.007404327,620.9449613,0.330760731,0.071970941,3.83e-05,141.3203276,0.075277549,83.99646521,0.044742665,12654.0,5910.0,2822.0,3098.0,10150.0,3772.0,14334.0,6496.762234,173.0,508.9935739,5814.76866,7117.165101,802.8032625,1822.109738,4492.252101,4302.839348,1822.396935,1857.232328,623.210084,5003.810677,3609.581315,1136.045477,258.1838853,50320.28696,2062.646208,48639.2515,2820.153028,1170.384343,45819.09847,1128.857338,52.8243317,21.0,26.43835243,103.0,18.19258047,96.01691217,828.6833061,545.1402073,703,636,59405,85,727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.999741397,0.999650105,0.337230861,0.776585451,0.263752461,0.090891078,0.049558386,1.0,1.0,0.50914719

We started At Home Inn Chicago in 2000 as a reservation service for bed and breakfasts in Chicago, and have since evolved into one of the city's most-respected sources for vacation rentals, corporate housing, and weekend getaways. 

We provide fully furnished vacation rentals and corporate housing throughout the city in or near Old Town and Lincoln Park.

We are here to answer all of your questions about Chicago, whether you need a restaurant recommendation, public transit tips, or insider tips on how to experience the Chicago that locals know and love. 

We love this city, especially getting ribs at Twin Anchors in Old Town before a show at Second City.  Topo Gigio is a great local Italian Restaurant and The Gemini Bistro is an excellent choice for fine dining. And Velvet Taco, casual with its own unique style on Lincoln is fabulous!

The free concerts at Pritzker Pavilion in Millenium Park can't be matched by any city in the world. 

We'd love to help you experience all of this with us and so much more!",within an hour,100.0,98.0,True,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/e23d4143-c790-4849-88a2-b7d9ac8bd873.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/e23d4143-c790-4849-88a2-b7d9ac8bd873.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Old Town,10,82,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",True,True,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",Lincoln Park,,41.91175,-87.63834,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,5,,1 bath,2.0,2.0,"[""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib - available upon request"", ""Self check-in"", ""Oven"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Window AC unit"", ""Shared backyard \u2013 Fully fenced"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free street parking"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Dryer"", ""Stove"", ""Keypad"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Washer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Heating"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Wifi"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Microwave"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Cooking basics""]",169.0,4,1125,3,4,1125,1125,3.9,1125.0,,True,14,28,36,82,2023-03-19,86,17,0,3470.0,36.0,4.78,4.91,4.76,4.87,4.78,4.96,4.78,2209985,True,10,10,0,0,0.74,7,Lincoln Park,64320,64116,70492,35570,1.903120607,69568.0,3329.0,9328.0,29869.0,11292.0,9326.0,4059.0,1731.0,634.0,30.5704314,55637.0,4349.0,2636.0,5084.0,1862.0,65828.0,60147.0,45825.0,44394.0,1431.0,14322.0,43722.0,5313.0,38409.0,13255.0,1872.0,17886.0,4004.0,1392.0,1189940.0,9903.0,15489.0,5679.0,949.0,48540.0,952.0,2047.0,3281.0,856.0,22468.0,18936.0,3888.0,2849.0,3340.0,3862.0,5471.0,12610.0,117048.0738,90189.4832,32020.0,14515.0,17505.0,3053.0,35073.0,3918.0,3422.0,1491.0,5067.0,4311.0,2394.0,14373.0,97.0,4.68339984,4053.0,12407.0,5378.0,13235.0,1966.528539,13562.0,10719.0,6127.0,3014.0,1651.0,337.0,1619.0,3109.0,7064.0,578379.862,17239.0,886.0,1388.0,4039.0,7624.0,3302.0,1746.473605,30711.0,812.0,1309.0,30449.0,29499.0,1571.0,33843,Professional,Finance,Health Care,Education,Accommodation and Food Service,7629,4277,3300,2562,2301,23505,Retail Trade,Accommodation and Food Service,Health Care,Transportation,Other Service,5189,4417,2992,2150,2139,The Loop,Outside of Chicago,Near North Side,Near West Side,Lincoln Park,11089,8428,5285,3090,1203,Outside of Chicago,Lake View,Lincoln Park,West Town,Uptown,8965,1310,1203,775,759,,,,8076.595753,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.001937146,0.998062854,3.933682487,2024.46434,316.8030406,0.156487341,366.2687834,0.180921331,65.33751225,0.032273975,250.9564733,0.123961913,104.7409704,0.051737622,38.89093047,0.019210479,541.0729154,0.2672672,0.0,0.0,310.5716001,0.153409272,29.82211401,0.014730867,13368.0,11312.0,3388.0,3952.0,12167.0,690.0,19853.0,2677.0,78.0,293.0,2306.0,3398.0,158.0,424.0,2816.0,3298.0,641.0,1201.0,1456.0,21835.0,13062.0,6089.0,2684.0,60432.0,9136.0,66239.0,10341.0,1947.0,55898.0,3067.0,1290.0,1276.0,153.0,262.0,191.0,609.0,3149.0,344.0,54341,3254,3323,2325,1077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.999331703,0.994723449,0.870622167,0.859884723,0.551002761,0.0,0.04095344,1.0,1.0,0.664997027

Born and raised in Chicago, we became avid travellers and barter enthusiasts. With over 20 years of travelling we could easily write our own book on travelling on a budget.  We PRIDE ourselves on the deals we obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.  We are geeked when we find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, our website for our guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.  It places you in parts of the world where you probably wouldn't have gone but always wanted to go to get that 'local' feel with a local and trusted host.   

Since we don't travel as much as I used to....Let your experience be our experience!

We have businesses that allow us to travel almost anywhere! Our motto is, as long as a place has WIFI, we can work from there! So we usually go there :)

Henrik's from Oslo Norway, since he moved to Chicago, he's used Airbnb to keep his home there while he lives with me in Chicago! When we are in Norway or elsewhere in the world, we open up 1350 to beautiful people like yourself.

Because we work from home we have made 1350 our shrine. We love 1350 so much. Whenever a new person comes into our home, they feel a sense of peace and expansion. We have spent many years pouring our love and energy into 1350. Because we travel often to Norway for long periods of time, we figured why not share our place with folks who will feel the love there. 

When we are home in Chicago, we like to host and entertain people. Katelyn loves to cook and make yummy cocktails for her friends & family while Henrik likes to dance and make people laugh. If we are not at home, you probably will find us at our favorite BYOB sushi joints or for a burger and mussels at Tuamns Tap. We are a laid back couple who loves to connect with humans making an impact in the world.

Folks pay a premium to live here, but most agree it’s well worth the hefty price tag.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-840579724567558957/original/4d412519-7cd6-4ef3-84a6-30e7ddaf47a2.jpeg,396270947,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/396270947,Jennifer,709,,,within a few hours,92.0,96.0,False,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f94c0775-5a44-44eb-b5c5-c54dccb69ea1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f94c0775-5a44-44eb-b5c5-c54dccb69ea1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,West Loop,62,69,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",True,False,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",Near North Side,,41.89129996167937,-87.63651267619676,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Pool table"", ""Self check-in"", ""City skyline view"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""First aid kit"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Fire pit"", ""Washer"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Kitchen"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Exercise equipment"", ""TV"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Wifi"", ""Building staff"", ""Pool"", ""BBQ grill""]",199.0,32,365,32,32,365,365,32.0,365.0,,True,0,17,47,322,2023-03-19,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,True,47,47,0,0,,8,Near North Side,72811,80484,105481,66685,1.556212042,95405.0,3075.0,5146.0,40387.0,16444.0,15699.0,9391.0,3818.0,1445.0,34.6875,65899.0,5807.0,6613.0,13882.0,3204.0,93075.0,89348.0,67722.0,65976.0,1724.0,21626.0,65357.0,8658.0,56699.0,15688.0,1604.0,15098.0,19829.0,4480.0,1430715.0,26302.0,27446.0,4662.0,683.0,79992.0,1477.0,3970.0,5966.0,1954.0,34226.0,32399.0,7839.0,5295.0,7377.0,7074.0,9457.0,22051.0,109049.1788,105016.5142,59093.0,24067.0,35026.0,10791.0,69884.0,1401.0,1788.0,330.0,1428.0,1567.0,1539.0,61779.0,52.0,3.63667576,22382.0,25373.0,12131.0,9998.0,1983.516266,40806.0,20051.0,6964.0,1485.0,578.0,942.0,5001.0,6911.0,8638.0,441896.3616,34062.0,2003.0,1245.0,3676.0,18076.0,9062.0,2005.399702,57519.0,2008.0,1574.0,56843.0,53161.0,2250.0,52122,Professional,Finance,Health Care,Education,Administration,11740,6662,5536,3640,3567,183945,Professional,Accommodation and Food Service,Health Care,Retail Trade,Administration,29488,28671,25047,17172,14412,The Loop,Outside of Chicago,Near North Side,Near West Side,West Town,17836,12943,10391,4525,666,Outside of Chicago,Near North Side,Lake View,West Town,Lincoln Park,79727,10391,8658,6240,5285,,,,5747.159759,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.81e-05,0.0,0.999901871,2.338548935,1755.342134,83.26410002,0.047434684,304.8611274,0.173676186,22.99715711,0.013101239,293.1675238,0.167014463,123.9315345,0.070602495,66.80066059,0.038055636,759.8958759,0.432904709,0.981433057,0.000559112,52.11896806,0.029691629,47.32375394,0.026959846,33962.0,20393.0,3015.0,1723.0,17493.0,1109.0,41600.0,5298.0,68.0,465.0,4765.0,6144.0,445.0,683.0,5016.0,7235.0,390.0,1769.0,5076.0,38330.0,22655.0,10093.0,5582.0,78931.0,16474.0,92330.0,17130.0,3210.0,75200.0,3533.0,1603.0,2494.0,300.0,659.0,994.0,1403.0,5788.0,356.0,50397,2805,13884,4434,1291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.999735737,1.0,0.857323232,0.862126017,0.14190658,0.0,0.022251037,1.0,1.0,0.691417905

Life in this neighborhood was explored in Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle. The area was formerly part of the town of Lake until it was annexed by Chicago in 1889. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area was occupied largely by Eastern European immigrants and their descendants, who were predominantly ethnic Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak.[2]<br /><br />In the 1930s the activist Saul Alinsky did community organizing in this area, as its people suffered during the Great Depression. This work led to his founding the Industrial Areas Foundation in 1940, which trained community organizers.[3]<br /><br />Jane Jacobs in her 1961 book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, cites the Back of the Yards as an area able to ""unslum"" in the 1960s, due to a beneficial set of circum",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-38454628/original/22008c50-d599-4d7d-915e-e85c8474605e.jpeg,226582852,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/226582852,Jane And Kris,1581,"Chicago, IL",I love to meet new people and share my home with them :),within a few hours,100.0,83.0,False,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0b54f1f8-376c-440e-96ff-be5e68b06460.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0b54f1f8-376c-440e-96ff-be5e68b06460.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Back of the Yards,17,29,"['email', 'phone']",True,True,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",New City,,41.80114,-87.64835,Entire home,Entire home/apt,16,,1 bath,8.0,10.0,"[""Oven"", ""First aid kit"", ""Private entrance"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Microwave"", ""Shared backyard \u2013 Fully fenced"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free street parking"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Stove"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Toaster"", ""Heating"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Clothing storage: closet and dresser"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Wifi"", ""Bathtub"", ""Refrigerator"", ""TV"", ""Cooking basics""]",250.0,28,1125,28,28,1125,1125,28.0,1125.0,,True,30,60,90,365,2023-03-19,14,0,0,1261.0,617.0,4.64,4.57,4.36,4.57,4.71,4.0,4.57,R19000039905,False,17,2,15,0,0.33,61,New City,51721,44377,43628,13813,3.136176066,38971.68675,2807.53012,9136.686747,8504.481928,8346.626506,5388.783133,3018.337349,1504.963855,264.2771084,33.10160771,4815.819277,24095.39759,9006.86747,725.6024096,328.0,38617.90275,29311.92108,18485.20848,15374.91048,3110.297998,10826.7126,14919.45112,833.4381625,14086.01296,7447.228504,2496.014134,3199.37338,720.9976443,222.3992933,509705.2415,3745.222076,5559.339685,2934.049934,1030.782523,24212.51807,7419.951807,9475.156627,3790.554217,1300.096386,1567.289157,659.4698795,4988.283298,3713.300211,1853.987315,1262.930233,842.9302326,603.0761099,35396.3424,18005.11013,13264.5074,4512.11985,8754.71161,2510.731501,15777.66292,3962.089888,210.5917603,6003.775281,3651.179775,1051.026217,59.0,407.0,433.0,5.414453311,1028.479401,2076.614232,4242.543071,8430.026217,1936.790077,1048.808989,6786.333333,5736.337079,1520.719101,685.4644195,2151.198732,1882.877378,365.0274841,106.0,154987.8477,8444.403805,991.6701903,5329.754757,1857.978858,265.0,0.0,798.0487731,10788.94292,2113.983087,2475.564482,10587.94292,10004.94292,2676.564482,12486,Health Care,Accommodation and Food Service,Administration,Manufacturing,Retail Trade,1572,1460,1364,1348,1296,10963,Manufacturing,Wholesale Trade,Retail Trade,Transportation,Other Service,3961,1762,1082,766,763,Outside of Chicago,The Loop,Near North Side,Near West Side,New City,4819,1722,762,725,571,Outside of Chicago,New City,Brighton Park,Gage Park,Chicago Lawn,4998,571,370,291,284,,,,11108.90407,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.016404769,0.076177653,0.907417578,1.708881576,3090.839377,244.9375784,0.079246298,328.0891063,0.10614887,30.8701408,0.009987624,155.0514493,0.050164836,94.56597553,0.030595564,722.2718265,0.23368145,1143.480819,0.369958021,0.0,0.0,83.76399579,0.027100728,287.8084858,0.09311661,4214.803383,2840.852008,2145.564482,4063.287526,8285.704017,2345.917548,4978.803383,3161.519711,149.0,133.0,2879.519711,4828.714849,691.2444152,1455.587385,2681.883049,1853.20565,944.4743758,592.2095926,316.521682,2709.890276,2152.978318,439.4868594,117.4250986,28372.73263,10599.06949,36167.94935,20619.91402,10147.54888,15548.03534,19748.9788,216.7997644,479.155477,6.0,0.0,0.0,116.0,52.0,0.979976443,6789,25948,18252,146,586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.999017682,0.555383955,0.145995287,0.77199033,0.0,0.0,0.172919445,1.0,1.0,0.485930968

It's not a trendy/hip neighborhood (just yet) so we lack a lot of walking to restaurants and marketing for shopping. However there are a few nice places that you can walk, and which I will recommend. There are loads of grocery stores about a mile away in every direction. We especially like the 24 hour hamburger stand (Suzie's) in the summer time, for shakes and grilled goodies. A greasy spoon for breakfast is the Golden Nugget. New to the hood is the amazing Old Irving Brewing brewpub which many guests frequent several times per week because it's so good and so close. Other stuff: I prefer Sarapino's or Lou Malnati's for pizza, #1 Chop Suey or Chen's Garden for Chinese, and PotBelly or Jimmy Johns for sandwiches. We have a couple Starbucks as well as two awesome independent coffee shops (Cafe Urbano and Coffee Roasters). All fairly close by. We go to mass at St Eds across the street.

That's my three kids in the scooter sidecar with me when they were young. They recently moved to Reading, PA and I visit them every few weeks. My oldest daughter is all grown up in Texas with my grandson. 
I worked for Apple for 6 years. I currently consult with companies about technology/internet/social media/marketing/branding. I work at AbbVie as a contractor for the last two years. 
We own the entire building and I work and live (some of the time) on the third floor with tenants on first floor. We use AirBnB for the Garden Apartment (totally private); the second floor is a hostel style AirBnB; and upstairs on the 3rd floor we have up to two bedrooms that are available when I don’t have my kids in town.
I enjoy going on bike rides to the beach with my kids, and my girlfriend and her kids. I love to read and I am a tech geek. I am a coffee OR tea drinker and after drinking both black for almost forty years, I have started using cream in them — a habit I picked up in Nairobi, Kenya a couple years ago when I was doing some missionary work (plus my girlfriend uses cream and so I have no choice). 
If I had to pick some things I can't live without: my girlfriend (and her boys); my kids; my technology; my morning coffee; my fellowship; and my friends. And I love to watch movies. Old. New. Comedy. Mystery. Action. It doesn't matter. I like them all. 
I enjoy working out — lifting weights, rowing machine, Pilates, and riding a bike; plus I am a life-long swimmer. I also recently started playing hockey! At my age (over 50!). Crazy. 
We have been hosting guests for over five years now. We have over 250 reviews 98% are 5 star. We are a SuperHost. We love this. And we are really good at it.
I am a pretty laid back guy. I like things to be neat and tidy, but it's hard to do without motivation. AirBnB has been the motivation to get our place all tricked out and we are very proud of it. We hope you will enjoy staying here. All of our units are in a great neighborhood—in a great city. We have lots of suggestions for fun stuff to do, not the typical touristy stuff, but cool Chicago things that Chicagoans like to do/see.",within an hour,100.0,76.0,True,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/634b9593-3adb-445a-8fbc-22ca63a8d9f8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/634b9593-3adb-445a-8fbc-22ca63a8d9f8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Irving Park,12,12,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",True,True,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",Irving Park,,41.962921,-87.735283,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,,1.5 shared baths,1.0,1.0,"[""Self check-in"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Oven"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Blender"", ""First aid kit"", ""Exercise equipment: free weights, stationary bike, yoga mat"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""60\"" HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, premium cable, standard cable"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Bed linens"", ""Single level home"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Board games"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Conditioner"", ""Body soap"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""Babysitter recommendations"", ""Shared backyard \u2013 Fully fenced"", ""Beach essentials"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Essentials"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In unit"", ""Hangers"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Smart lock"", ""Free street parking"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Sound system with Bluetooth and aux"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Stove"", ""Shower gel"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Freezer"", ""Coffee"", ""Clothing storage: wardrobe"", ""Fire pit"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Free washer \u2013 In unit"", ""Barbecue utensils"", ""Toaster"", ""Heating"", ""Record player"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Portable fans"", ""Fast wifi \u2013 133 Mbps"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Rice maker"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Dining table"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Microwave"", ""Cooking basics""]",36.0,2,90,2,2,90,90,2.0,90.0,,True,28,58,88,267,2023-03-19,30,10,0,2483.0,105.0,4.9,5.0,4.87,4.83,5.0,4.87,4.9,R19000039377,False,12,3,9,0,0.36,16,Irving Park,58643,53359,51940,21342,2.417861494,53604.0,3735.0,8438.0,13439.0,13246.0,9193.0,3457.0,1679.0,417.0,36.20763142,23585.0,22062.0,1466.0,4602.0,1889.0,53157.0,43444.0,32457.0,30525.0,1912.0,10987.0,30174.0,3681.0,26493.0,15555.0,2132.0,7301.0,1178.0,327.0,964240.0,2861.0,9417.0,6857.0,1781.0,38537.0,5235.0,7811.0,6423.0,2265.0,10601.0,6202.0,2687.0,4221.0,3983.0,2780.0,3305.0,3940.0,72045.04095,38887.99043,20916.0,10653.0,10263.0,1966.0,22882.0,6251.0,870.0,4968.0,3585.0,3666.0,1750.0,1741.0,51.0,5.568837059,1703.0,2012.0,4489.0,14678.0,1928.973293,4419.0,9335.0,5570.0,2273.0,1285.0,807.0,3266.0,3492.0,3049.0,359700.0484,9972.0,406.0,2674.0,4772.0,1977.0,143.0,1170.727338,19855.0,1741.0,1061.0,18798.0,18276.0,2118.0,23181,Health Care,Professional,Accommodation and Food Service,Retail Trade,Education,2905,2369,2308,2112,2036,10716,Wholesale Trade,Health Care,Retail Trade,Arts and Entertainment,Accommodation and Food Service,1781,1771,1135,997,948,Outside of Chicago,The Loop,Near North Side,Near West Side,Irving Park,8353,4310,2138,1415,714,Outside of Chicago,Irving Park,Belmont Cragin,Austin,Portage Park,4364,714,390,354,343,,,,12749.05106,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.255109414,2057.194253,516.2064438,0.250927419,403.7078639,0.196241975,47.47435967,0.023077237,102.862972,0.050001584,72.97631344,0.035473711,67.10794937,0.032621105,742.7564039,0.36105312,0.0,0.0,94.31377774,0.04584583,9.788169414,0.004758019,6124.0,6694.0,3611.0,4487.0,12590.0,1424.0,8326.0,1639.0,0.0,78.0,1561.0,4899.0,247.0,1026.0,3626.0,3934.0,785.0,1954.0,1195.0,9953.0,6376.0,2607.0,970.0,39475.0,14129.0,49869.0,22912.0,9282.0,26957.0,15934.0,1567.0,138.0,1477.0,647.0,171.0,772.0,1992.0,214.0,25912,25401,1121,4362,1847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.494797208,0.855120129,0.0,0.0,0.067236085,1.0,1.0,0.473652814

Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.
Pricing & calendar availability is accurate on FHS website only.

Originating as a home and trade center for Native American nations, including Potawatomi, Miami and Illinois, the area was founded in the 1850s by German settlers. Immigrants began to farm potatoes, celery and cabbage, which is where Old Town inherited its nickname as “The Cabbage Patch” in the early 1900s.<br /><br />The German settlers also built St. Michael’s Church, the oldest Victorian building in the neighborhood, and one of the only buildings that survived the Great Chicago Fire.

Our apartments are in the south and west loop of downtown Chicago. The museums, stadiums (United Center, Soldier Field, etc.), and McCormick Place, Thalia hall, China town, University of Illinois, University of Chicago,  Rush university, Medical district are all close and easily accessible. The magnificent mile is: 9 minutes by bus and 5 minutes by taxi or Uber. 

Some of the apartments are 420 friendly; ask about it if you are interested! 
 
We are friendly people who enjoy meeting new friends and traveling. We have lived in the Caribbean, London, and New York before moving to Chicago. Came to Chicago primarily for school but then we loved it and decided to stay. Yes, we love Chicago, and even the winter is GREAT! Good food options are unbelievably amazing in Chicago.

I have multiple apartments on this website. Some of the apartments are  3 bedrooms, bathroom, living room, dining room, and kitchen. Some are two bedrooms, bathroom, living, and kitchen and the others are 1 bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. We provide additional airbeds if needed. The airbeds are extremely comfortable and are queen size and 18 inches high. 

All the apartments have free WiFi, guestbooks, and basic amenities such as TV, iron, iron board, refrigerator, hair dryer, with water, pop, and juice, microwave, coffee maker, cups, plates, pots, pans, bathroom towels, shower items, etc.

Airbnb is extremely fun for us since we are also international.  We have traveled to most of the states in the US, London, Milan,  Italy, Turkey. I have also attended Universities on both sides of the Atlantic (London and Chicago). 

Favorite music are Reggae, R&B, hip hop, Latin music, country music. I love to eat and my favorite food are fish, fruits, and vegetables. My favorite sports are rock climbing, archery, diving, soccer, and basketball. 

These days if I am not out with friends, I am with family, or spending time on the computer.

We started with just renting out our own apartment whenever we were out sailing.  Brad and I were former colleagues on cruise ships. Hence, this business is something we are very passionate about. Then we saw an opportunity and everything just grew from there.   We also met and  teamed up with other hosts in Chicago.   We shared ideas and resources which proved to be a win-win for everyone. We also market our units together on some online platforms.

In the event you booked and made a mistake and catch it within an hour, go up to your itinerary and hit cancel.  It will say you get no refund.

Hello!  This is Joe, Alex, and Charlie.  If you stay here we will be your hosts while here in Chicago.   You may also hear from Bilal, Thomas, or Drew as they assist us sometimes.  Do NOT go to them on site and ask Airbnb related stuff as they are not paid for that.  

We are Airbnb Superhosts not because we have a 5 star luxury property, but because we just about always deliver on what we offer.  The best value in Chicago at this price point doing mostly shared, hostel-style accommodations.  


Please read through our entire ad and offering before asking questions or requesting a stay.  If after that you still have questions feel free to ask.  If you just want to book after reading, I'm positive we will deliver a great stay.   

Its not personal, but if you ask us questions located in our ad, we're probably going to redirect you there. A requirement on Airbnb is for a guest to read and abide by a hosts house rules and ad which is impossible if you dont  read them.  This is our way of gently helping people learn to use the platform the right way and prevent issues.  

99% of guest issues are related to the property not matching the guests expectations.  If the host is doing their job right, their ad should paint a pretty clear picture of what life is like at their place.



All of our listings include desks, gigabit internet to share, a full array of breakfast items including bacon, eggs, milk, orange juice, coffee, cereal, tea, oatmeal, at least 2x of fruit, 2x of vegi, cheese,  bread and jam, and we also take requests for other items that you may enjoy like yogurt, almond milk, or other vegis and fruits we dont already have.  We also often cook for guests and like filling the cookie jar with delicious baked goods throughout the month.  

We have been hosting here for 10 years and absolutely love it.  If youd like to share a drink or toke some of the shrubbery with me, let me know and I may be able to make that happen =)  We are 420 friendly in the backyard.  

We love Airbnb, Chicago, and our guests.   If privacy and being downtown are not important to you, you'll be hard pressed to find a better Airbnb experience in Chicago at this price point and if you do, we'll probably price match. 

NO room may have more than 2 adults.  The system has no way of differentiating adults from kids so this is the only way we can accommodate those with kids.  If you book with three adults, we will not be able to host the third in the same room.  

We all look forwarding to meeting those of you who book with us!",within an hour,100.0,96.0,True,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,West Ridge,14,21,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",True,True,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",West Ridge,,42.0165228,-87.6877932,Private room in rental unit,Private room,4,,2 shared baths,1.0,2.0,"[""Dedicated workspace"", ""Oven"", ""Host greets you"", ""Bathtub"", ""First aid kit"", ""Clothing storage: closet"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Bed linens"", ""Dining table"", ""Board games"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Private backyard \u2013 Fully fenced"", ""Conditioner"", ""Body soap"", ""Microwave"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free street parking"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Paid dryer \u2013 In building"", ""Iron"", ""Bidet"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Mini fridge"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Coffee maker: drip coffee maker, french press, Keurig coffee machine"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Stove"", ""Shower gel"", ""Coffee"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Toaster"", ""Paid washer \u2013 In building"", ""Central heating"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Breakfast"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Wifi"", ""Game console: PS3"", ""Refrigerator"", ""TV"", ""Cooking basics""]",37.0,1,365,2,2,365,365,2.0,365.0,,True,22,52,82,167,2023-03-19,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,R21000075752,False,14,0,5,9,,2,West Ridge,73199,71942,77122,26493,2.850979504,78763.0,6570.0,16177.0,16026.0,15628.0,14314.0,5822.0,2863.0,1363.0,35.61764109,33123.0,15514.0,9166.0,16556.0,4404.0,77138.0,59984.0,38949.0,36492.0,2457.0,21035.0,34994.0,2226.0,32768.0,21479.0,2830.0,5643.0,2142.0,674.0,1089900.0,3522.0,12383.0,7655.0,2309.0,51975.0,9041.0,10150.0,8360.0,2764.0,14316.0,7344.0,4875.0,6072.0,5004.0,3021.0,3486.0,3411.0,57937.30032,27671.16952,25869.0,12557.0,13312.0,2185.0,28054.0,5574.0,1405.0,3216.0,6197.0,5131.0,1901.0,4584.0,46.0,5.481163045,851.0,3864.0,12078.0,11261.0,1947.066939,5874.0,10419.0,9151.0,1749.0,861.0,2767.0,4074.0,4378.0,1230.0,274096.6387,13108.0,701.0,2985.0,6861.0,2432.0,129.0,1181.841238,24375.0,2751.0,1494.0,22756.0,21700.0,3113.0,27115,Health Care,Accommodation and Food Service,Retail Trade,Education,Professional,5148,2828,2708,2427,2341,10101,Health Care,Professional,Retail Trade,Accommodation and Food Service,Other Service,4513,1483,1276,795,478,Outside of Chicago,The Loop,Near North Side,West Ridge,Near West Side,11872,3758,1920,1498,1154,Outside of Chicago,West Ridge,Rogers Park,Edgewater,Lincoln Square,4725,1498,329,274,195,,,,12110.68445,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.982161066,2259.62109,553.9782868,0.24516424,519.3462477,0.229837759,27.25764638,0.012062928,138.5040287,0.061295245,161.9069939,0.071652276,2.852632122,0.001262438,655.4780325,0.290083163,0.0,0.0,188.5313773,0.083434952,11.76584462,0.005206999,6582.0,7326.0,3920.0,8041.0,17852.0,2313.0,8017.0,3334.0,49.0,236.0,3049.0,7196.0,541.0,1058.0,5597.0,4996.0,1394.0,2083.0,1519.0,9854.0,7236.0,2123.0,495.0,46591.0,32172.0,72193.0,41569.0,19950.0,30624.0,11983.0,4115.0,851.0,1043.0,2896.0,303.0,4238.0,11462.0,4678.0,36403,11353,4962,16347,4134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.46991823,0.774886878,0.193018829,0.0,0.05449991,1.0,1.0,0.36694862

Hello!  This is Joe, Alex, and Charlie.  If you stay here we will be your hosts while here in Chicago.   You may also hear from Bilal, Thomas, or Drew as they assist us sometimes.  Do NOT go to them on site and ask Airbnb related stuff as they are not paid for that.  

We are Airbnb Superhosts not because we have a 5 star luxury property, but because we just about always deliver on what we offer.  The best value in Chicago at this price point doing mostly shared, hostel-style accommodations.  


Please read through our entire ad and offering before asking questions or requesting a stay.  If after that you still have questions feel free to ask.  If you just want to book after reading, I'm positive we will deliver a great stay.   

Its not personal, but if you ask us questions located in our ad, we're probably going to redirect you there. A requirement on Airbnb is for a guest to read and abide by a hosts house rules and ad which is impossible if you dont  read them.  This is our way of gently helping people learn to use the platform the right way and prevent issues.  

99% of guest issues are related to the property not matching the guests expectations.  If the host is doing their job right, their ad should paint a pretty clear picture of what life is like at their place.



All of our listings include desks, gigabit internet to share, a full array of breakfast items including bacon, eggs, milk, orange juice, coffee, cereal, tea, oatmeal, at least 2x of fruit, 2x of vegi, cheese,  bread and jam, and we also take requests for other items that you may enjoy like yogurt, almond milk, or other vegis and fruits we dont already have.  We also often cook for guests and like filling the cookie jar with delicious baked goods throughout the month.  

We have been hosting here for 10 years and absolutely love it.  If youd like to share a drink or toke some of the shrubbery with me, let me know and I may be able to make that happen =)  We are 420 friendly in the backyard.  

We love Airbnb, Chicago, and our guests.   If privacy and being downtown are not important to you, you'll be hard pressed to find a better Airbnb experience in Chicago at this price point and if you do, we'll probably price match. 

NO room may have more than 2 adults.  The system has no way of differentiating adults from kids so this is the only way we can accommodate those with kids.  If you book with three adults, we will not be able to host the third in the same room.  

We all look forwarding to meeting those of you who book with us!",within an hour,100.0,96.0,True,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,West Ridge,14,21,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",True,True,,West Ridge,,42.01744,-87.68881,Private room in rental unit,Private room,3,,2 shared baths,1.0,2.0,"[""Dedicated workspace"", ""Oven"", ""Host greets you"", ""First aid kit"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Bed linens"", ""Dining table"", ""Board games"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Conditioner"", ""Body soap"", ""Microwave"", ""Coffee maker: Keurig coffee machine"", ""Game console"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free street parking"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Iron"", ""Bidet"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Mini fridge"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Dryer"", ""Stove"", ""Shower gel"", ""Coffee"", ""Fire pit"", ""Backyard"", ""Washer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Toaster"", ""Heating"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Breakfast"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Wifi"", ""Bathtub"", ""Refrigerator"", ""TV"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Clothing storage""]",54.0,1,365,2,2,365,365,2.0,365.0,,True,0,0,0,0,2023-03-19,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,R21000075752,True,14,0,5,9,,2,West Ridge,73199,71942,77122,26493,2.850979504,78763.0,6570.0,16177.0,16026.0,15628.0,14314.0,5822.0,2863.0,1363.0,35.61764109,33123.0,15514.0,9166.0,16556.0,4404.0,77138.0,59984.0,38949.0,36492.0,2457.0,21035.0,34994.0,2226.0,32768.0,21479.0,2830.0,5643.0,2142.0,674.0,1089900.0,3522.0,12383.0,7655.0,2309.0,51975.0,9041.0,10150.0,8360.0,2764.0,14316.0,7344.0,4875.0,6072.0,5004.0,3021.0,3486.0,3411.0,57937.30032,27671.16952,25869.0,12557.0,13312.0,2185.0,28054.0,5574.0,1405.0,3216.0,6197.0,5131.0,1901.0,4584.0,46.0,5.481163045,851.0,3864.0,12078.0,11261.0,1947.066939,5874.0,10419.0,9151.0,1749.0,861.0,2767.0,4074.0,4378.0,1230.0,274096.6387,13108.0,701.0,2985.0,6861.0,2432.0,129.0,1181.841238,24375.0,2751.0,1494.0,22756.0,21700.0,3113.0,27115,Health Care,Accommodation and Food Service,Retail Trade,Education,Professional,5148,2828,2708,2427,2341,10101,Health Care,Professional,Retail Trade,Accommodation and Food Service,Other Service,4513,1483,1276,795,478,Outside of Chicago,The Loop,Near North Side,West Ridge,Near West Side,11872,3758,1920,1498,1154,Outside of Chicago,West Ridge,Rogers Park,Edgewater,Lincoln Square,4725,1498,329,274,195,,,,12110.68445,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.982161066,2259.62109,553.9782868,0.24516424,519.3462477,0.229837759,27.25764638,0.012062928,138.5040287,0.061295245,161.9069939,0.071652276,2.852632122,0.001262438,655.4780325,0.290083163,0.0,0.0,188.5313773,0.083434952,11.76584462,0.005206999,6582.0,7326.0,3920.0,8041.0,17852.0,2313.0,8017.0,3334.0,49.0,236.0,3049.0,7196.0,541.0,1058.0,5597.0,4996.0,1394.0,2083.0,1519.0,9854.0,7236.0,2123.0,495.0,46591.0,32172.0,72193.0,41569.0,19950.0,30624.0,11983.0,4115.0,851.0,1043.0,2896.0,303.0,4238.0,11462.0,4678.0,36403,11353,4962,16347,4134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.46991823,0.774886878,0.193018829,0.0,0.05449991,1.0,1.0,0.36694862

I am friendly, easygoing, and doing my best to enjoy and love life. You can have a great time here, the city has vibrant music, great food and shopping, and beautiful scenery. See you soon!

The Obama Center, only a 5 minute drive from the property, will be sure to contribute to the already vigorous comeback of the area.  <br /><br />The much anticipated and lauded $100 Regal Mile Studios broke ground in February 2023 (slated to open Fall 2024) four blocks to the south of our home.  The Regal Mile Studios project is a 380,000-square foot (7 acre) state-of-the-art media campus.<br /><br />The block the home is located on is residential, quiet and safe with many working families who have long standing roots in the local community. <br /><br />Supermarkets, banks (PNC), fast food and some retail are a short drive or walk from the home. The nearest decent restaurants are in Hyde Park, a 12 minute drive. <br /><br />Downtown Chicago is about a 20-25 minute drive and public transport is within 5 min walking distance.  <b",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/c8818163-e3c8-4509-817e-585351fbb06d.jpg,72651433,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/72651433,Zafar,2496,"Chicago, IL","Hello and welcome!

I am a 54yr old(in February 2021) Command Master Chief, Persian Gulf war veteran and semiretired government law enforcement agent from the United States Department of Homeland Security.

I love reading and expanding my knowledge. I love a multitude of animé, comics and music. I am a gigantic music lover that loves listening to music from abroad and have a very extensive & multicultural music library. I definitely love to wrestle and have an overall good sparring match no matter how big, young, old or experienced my opponent is.

I am the type of person who thinks beyond outside the box. My thinking and mindset is on a whole other level, astral plane and dimension, so you can be laid back, comfortable and overall be yourself in my home without being in fear of being looked @ differently nor judged for being not ""Normal"" by other's standards. 

I'm not weird or normal, I am unique and magical unicorn wizard that poops rainbows, Lol. So yea, I believe you will feel comfortable in my home when I am present.

I am a very overprotective father and friend when it comes to the people I love and care deeply about. I'm a bit of a antisocial introvert, but strike up a conversation that interests my medulla oblongata and I can converse for hours. 

As you can tell, I love to be detailed and thorough and give as much information as possible instead of the usual ""Bits & pieces"" that people do nowadays.

I am extremely clean & organised. I can be a bit strict and rough around the edges, but I'm overall loyal, loving, kind hearted and a overall true person.
